# PowerBI-Projects
This project about Employees dataset describes all information about them and we visualize this info using Power BI Desktop. 
Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. By using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data. Additionally, it provides an excellent way for employees or business owners to present data to non-technical audiences without confusion.
